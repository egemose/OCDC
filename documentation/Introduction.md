# Introduction
This tool, **Color Based Segmenter for Orthomosaics** makes it possible to calculate a distance to a reference color for each pixel in georeferenced orthomosaic.

The **Color Based Segmenter for Orthomosaics** tool was developed by Henrik Skov Midtiby as part of the project *Præcisionsfrøavl*, that was supported by the [Green Development and Demonstration Programme (GUDP)](https://gudp.lbst.dk/) and [Frøafgiftsfonden](https://froeafgiftsfonden.dk/) both from Denmark. 

To install the system, the following howto can be useful
* [Howto - Install the Color Based Segmenter for Orthomosaics](Howto_Install.md)

After having installed the system, the next step is to follow the tutorial.
