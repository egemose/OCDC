# Introduction
This tool, **Orthomosaic Color Distance Calculator** makes it possible to calculate a distance to a reference color for each pixel in georeferenced orthomosaic.

The **Orthomosaic Color Distance Calculator** tool was developed by Henrik Skov Midtiby as part of the project *Præcisionsfrøavl*, that was supported by the [Green Development and Demonstration Programme (GUDP)](https://gudp.lbst.dk/) and [Frøafgiftsfonden](https://froeafgiftsfonden.dk/) both from Denmark. 

To install the system, the following howto can be useful
